# Connect4AI

Here's a game of Connect 4 that is playable with an AI! You can also play with another human if you wish, or you can even do AI vs AI! If you don't feel like choosing, you can always pick random and see who you'll go up against! I was just responsible for programming the AI part of this project. I really enjoyed how it came out and wanted to show you a little bit of it. 

To start the game, you must type 

  'python3 ConnectFour.py arg1 arg2'

where the arguments would either be human, ai, or random.

After this command, the game board should pop up. Whoever is arg1 will start the game. 

If it's a human's turn, they must type in a number from 0 - 6 in the terminal, 0 being the first column and 6 being the last column, to place their piece on the board. After they have entered in their column number, they must click on 'Next Move' on the board. Then it will be arg2's turn.

If it's the AI's turn, all you have to do is click on 'Next Move' as the AI will select the column number on it's own and place it's piece. Warning, sometimes it may take a little while for it to place it's piece. After this, it is the other player's turn.

My AI may not be the best but there are definitely sometimes where it will catch you off guard! Let me know what you think of it!
